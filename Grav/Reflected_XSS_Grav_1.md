## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Reflected endpoint** `/admin/pages/[page]`, **parameter** `data[header][content][items]`, **located in the "Blog Config" tab.

---

## Summary

A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `/admin/pages/[page]` endpoint of the _Grav_ application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `data[header][content][items]` parameter.

---

## Details

**Vulnerable Endpoint:** `GET /admin/pages/[page]`  
**Parameter:** `data[header][content][items]`

The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user input in the `data[header][content][items]` parameter. As a result, attackers can craft a malicious URL with an XSS payload. When this URL is accessed, the injected script is reflected back in the HTTP response and executed within the context of the victim's browser session.

## PoC

**Payload:**

`"><ImG sRc=x OnErRoR=alert('XSS-PoC3')>`

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Log in to the _Grav_ Admin Panel and navigate to **Pages**.
    
2. Create a new page or edit an existing one.
    
3. In the **Advanced > Blog Config > Items** field (which maps to `data[header][content][items]`), insert the payload above.

4. Save the page.
     
5. The malicious payload is reflected and rendered by the application without proper sanitization. The JavaScript code is immediately executed in the browser.
