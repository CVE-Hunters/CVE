# Description
# Impact
An endpoint used to display details of users listed in certain fields (such as ACLs) could be misused to dump basic user details (such as name, affiliation and email) in bulk.

# Tip

If your instance allows everyone to create a user account, and you wish to truly restrict access to these user details, consider restricting user search to managers. You can find details on the newly introduced indico.conf setting ALLOW_PUBLIC_USER_SEARCH in our documentation.

# Patches
You should to update to Indico 3.3.7 as soon as possible.
See the docs for instructions on how to update.

# Workarounds
It is possible to restrict access to the affected endpoints (e.g. in the webserver config), but doing so would break certain form fields which could no longer show the details of the users listed in those fields, so upgrading instead is highly recommended.
