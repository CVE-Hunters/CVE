## Summary

A **Weak Password Policy** vulnerability was identified in the user registration functionality of the _Novosga_ application. This vulnerability allows the creation of accounts with extremely weak and predictable passwords, such as `123456`. This exposes the platform to brute-force and credential stuffing attacks.

---

## Details

**Vulnerable Component:** User registration / password creation  

The application fails to enforce a strong password policy. As a result, users can register accounts with trivial and well-known weak passwords, compromising the authentication security of the platform.

---

## PoC

1. Navigate to the user registration page after logged in with the Administrator account

2. Create a new user account with the password `123456`.

```

```

3. The application accepts the weak password without restrictions and creates the account successfully.

## Impact

Weak password policy vulnerabilities can have significant consequences, including:

- Increased risk of brute-force and credential stuffing attacks
    
- Unauthorized access to user or administrative accounts
    
- Privilege escalation through compromised accounts
    
- Reduced overall security posture of the application
    

### **Mitigation**

- Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, use of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters).
    
- Prevent the use of commonly known weak passwords (e.g., via blocklists such as “123456”, “password”, “qwerty”).
    
- Encourage or enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) to mitigate the risk of compromised weak passwords.
    
- Implement rate-limiting or account lockout mechanisms to slow down brute-force attempts.
