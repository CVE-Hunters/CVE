---

## Summary

A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `/intranet/educar_avaliacao_desempenho_lst.php` endpoint of the _i-educar_ application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `titulo_avaliacao` parameter.

---

## Details

**Vulnerable Endpoint:** `GET /intranet/educar_avaliacao_desempenho_lst.php`  
**Parameter:** `titulo_avaliacao`

The application fails to validate and sanitize user input in the `titulo_avaliacao` parameter. This lack of input validation permits the injection of a malicious script payload, which is reflected in the HTTP response and executed in the victim’s browser context.
