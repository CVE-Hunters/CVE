# CVE-2025-9823 Reflected XSS in lead:addLeadTags - Quick Add

## Summary

A DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of another user's session. This occurs because user-supplied input is improperly handled in the client-side JavaScript before sanitization is applied, potentially enabling malicious actions such as session hijacking, credential theft, or unauthorized actions in the application.

## Details

The vulnerability resides in the "Tags" input field on the /s/ajax?action=lead:addLeadTags endpoint. When a user inputs a malicious payload, such as:

`"><script>alert('XSS')</script>`

The application processes this input on the client-side and directly manipulates the DOM using insecure methods like innerHTML. Although the server applies sanitization to the data before storing it or sending it back to the client, the payload is executed immediately in the browser before this sanitization takes effect.

## Patches

This vulnerability has been patched in Mautic 7.0.0-beta1 and later versions. The fix modifies the chosen-js patch to use jQuery's `.text()` method instead of string concatenation, preventing XSS attacks when adding new tag options to the DOM.

## Technical Details

The vulnerability was caused by unsafe DOM manipulation in the chosen-js patch:

**Vulnerable code:**
```javascript
$(this.form_field).append('<option>' + newTag + '</option>');
```

**Fixed code:**
```javascript
$(this.form_field).append($('<option></option>').text(newTag));
```

The fix ensures that user input is properly escaped when creating DOM elements, preventing XSS injection.


## Impact
A Reflected XSS attack can have a significant impact, allowing attackers to steal sensitive user data like cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, manipulate the web page content, and essentially take control of a user's session within an application by executing malicious JavaScript code within the victim's browser, even if the server-side code is secure; essentially enabling them to perform actions as if they were the logged-in user.
